# Deadball Play — Implementation Plan

## Purpose

## Repository Strategy

All Version 1 work should occur inside the existing `deadball-web` repository.

Phase 0 should inspect the actual tree and establish the least disruptive monorepo-style boundaries, conceptually similar to:

```text
packages/
  deadball_generator/
  deadball_core/

apps/
  web/
  deadball_play/
```

Do not force those literal paths if the current repository already has a cleaner equivalent.

The important constraints are:

- reuse existing generator code
- introduce a reusable core for rules/state/events
- keep Deadball Play as a separate application layer
- preserve the existing web application
- avoid unnecessary cross-dependencies
- defer separate-repository extraction unless a future need justifies it

This document turns the current design into a concrete development sequence.

> **Phase numbering:** `phases.md` is the canonical execution sequence. This
> document contains a more granular architectural breakdown, so its phase
> numbers after Phase 0 do not map one-to-one to `phases.md`.

The plan assumes:

- the existing `deadball-web` generator remains the source of team/player ratings
- Version 1 targets Modern Era Deadball Second Edition
- the rules engine remains independent of the TUI
- the paper score sheet remains central
- computer-managed opposition uses Managerial Daring plus documented application procedures

The order is deliberately rules-first.

Do not "fix" an awkward computer-manager behavior by quietly changing Deadball rules.

## Done When

The solo game feels coherent and the distinction between Deadball mechanics and application procedure remains intact.

# Phase 17 — Version 1 Release Criteria

Version 1 is ready when:

- generated game data loads offline
- all core Modern Era rules are implemented
- rules tests cover numeric boundaries and tables
- a complete game can run from first pitch to final out
- one human-managed side works
- one Daring-managed opponent works
- save/resume works
- Undo works
- narration varies without changing facts
- TUI provides scoring guidance
- paper scorekeeping remains comfortable
- several deterministic full-game regression tests pass

The final acceptance question is:

> Can a player take a generated score sheet, a pen, and a computer and comfortably play a complete faithful game of Deadball Second Edition without needing the rulebook or dice?

If yes, Version 1 has met its purpose.

---

# Deferred Until After Version 1

Do not block the first release on:

- Ancient Era
- season/campaign management
- graphical interface
- cloud sync
- advanced manager tendencies
- manual physical-dice mode
- full digital scorebook
- voice synthesis
- radio-style broadcast
- expanded house rules

These should build outward from the stable core.
